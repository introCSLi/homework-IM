# Reading Response Design meets Disability Pullin 


 I used to think that good disability design is one that seamlessly fits into its surroundings and has that “invisible” quality so that people would not notice a person’s disability. However, I now agree with Pullin’s point that the way we design for disability directly influences the way we perceive it, and so design with the intention to camouflage might give the message that a disability is something to be hidden, rather than acknowledged and embraced. Pullin had used the example of eyewear design to illustrate this point. Nowadays, glasses are considered a fashion item rather than a medical device, as designs moved from skin colored frames to a plethora of options suiting almost every imaginable style. I do think that this shift was easier to achieve for glasses rather than hearing devices or prosthetics, simply because slight visual impairments are so common (according to the Vision Council of America, approximately 75% of adults use some sort of vision correction). Since disabilities are defined in relation to some human norm, and since the norm is to be in need of glasses, tis might make it easier to accept glasses in society compared to less common disabilities.  Nevertheless, I think it is important that this shift from mere tolerance to true inclusion needs to happen in more areas and putting emphasis on the aesthetics of design in addition to practicality is one way to achieve this goal, as it can help reduce the stigma around disabilities. 
 
 
 I think there is another important conversation around the way we approach design for disability that has not directly been mentioned by Pullin. It is the conceptual shift that naturally follows from the shift from tolerance to inclusion, that when designing for disability, one is not just trying to accommodate the needs of a specific group, but rather trying to improve the accessibility of the design to everybody and thereby make a better design to everyone.  This might seem to oppose Pullin’s call to more individualization rather than universality in disability design, however the two actually do not conflict, because they apply to different scales. Designing everyday products while keeping in mind users with disabilities can lead to better results than when designing for the norm, while for specialized products, universality can be counterproductive as seen in the examples given by Pullin.
