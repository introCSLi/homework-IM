**What does Computation mean to you?**

I understand computation to be information processing of all kinds. If something can return an output which is dependent on a given input, it could be considered a computational entity. With this definition, computation is not restricted to refer to computers and electric devices, but also to humans (and even all living beings), because our brains are essentially information processing machines. Even organisms without brains can take genomic information as an input and build a physical object from it as an output. Thinking is also computing, because our brains process sensory input to create our experience of being. 
In the broad sense of computing, we could not exist without it, because life itself is based on information processing.  
 
**What are you getting out of it, what do others get from it?**

Considering the ways in which the world is structured now, computation is making my life a lot easier. Staying in touch with people halfway across the globe is possible through the communication networks that are in place, which are all based on computation. Advancements in computational resources are catalyzing developments in basically all areas, from science to the arts, and thereby it is changing the way we create, produce, and express. With ever increasing computational resources, the trend is that it is taking over more and more aspects of our lives. 

**Is it helping you to become a better person?**

Right now, a very big part of my life revolves around interacting with computational devices. From the moment I wake up until I go to sleep, I am constantly near my phone or working on my laptop. Although computation affects every aspect of my life to some extent, I cannot say that it is making me a better person. It might make me more productive in working, or more knowledgeable, but being a better person, to me, is dependent on internal values which I would like to think are not so affected by computation. My personal goal of being a better person includes to be kind to others and to myself, to not take things for granted, and to be good to the people I care about. In achieving these objectives, computation does not play a very big role. In fact, some of the times when I felt most aligned with my personal goals was when I used technology very little. 

**Is it adding something to your life?**

Yes. I can hardly imagine what it would be like to live a life without any external computational devices by now. I rely on technology for planning my day, reminding me of tasks, keeping in touch with people, acquiring information, for creative input and output, entertainment, and more. All these are adding something to my life. However, I do not think that my dependency on external computation is all beneficial. It can actually take away from my life, rather than adding to it. There are a million other ways I could spend the time I have if I didnâ€™t need to be working on my computer all the time. I am currently actively trying to use technology only as a tool to achieve my goals, rather than becoming overly dependent on it.
