# Computer Vision for Artists and Designers - Golan Levin and Collaborators

I went to the Abu Dhabi Art exhibition and one of the works I saw there included an interactive installation based on computer vision (I added an image of the installation in the reading responses repository). The user would stand at a distance from a screen, and one’s contours were projected onto screen. Random objects appeared at the top of the screen which were attached to the person’s body with a string. The object could be pulled down and would follow the person around. Both visually and conceptually it reminded me a lot of the work Videoplace by Myron Krueger which was developed almost 50 years ago. Even though the concept is really simple, people seemed to be very fascinated by the installation.

The examples that I found most interesting from the ones mentioned by Levin are those where there are more levels of abstraction between the input from computer vision and the output of the project, such as the one by Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman (2003) where “the speech, shouts and songs produced by two abstract vocalists are visualized and augmented in real-time by synthetic graphics”, because it created a different perspective on how to perceive and experience sound.
