# Visualizing Gravitational Wave Detection

The data from Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) can be converted into soundfiles. I used the soundfile from the first detection which came from a neutrino star collision. I downloaded the file from here: https://www.gw-openscience.org/audio/

I tried to visualize the bending of spacetime using four lightcones on a black background. The lights change their position according to the amplitude of the soundfile. They shine light on a 3D sphere, which itself is not visible. The size of the sphere correlates to the amplitude. 

I added a beethoven sonata that can be visualized using the same code when commented in (for testing purposes) as the soundfile of the gravitational wave is only 4 seconds.
