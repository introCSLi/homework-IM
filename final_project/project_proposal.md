# the friendship booth

**Project description:**

My project idea is to use audio visualization to create a tangible manifestation of a conversation between two friends. Thereby, I want to spark an honest, appreciative exchange, resulting in a snapshot of a friendship. 
There will be different prompts on the screen, such as 

“What was your first impression of each other?”

“What is the favorite memory you have together?”

“Is there anything you want to tell your friend?’

The users can decide to follow these questions or have a conversation about anything else they like. 
If they decide to follow these questions, there will be a “next” button which makes the next question appear. The duration of this conversation will be set to a specific time. I will have to determine the exact time after some user testing, but I was thinking of around 3 minutes for the entire conversation. 
The conversation will be analyzed by frequency and amplitude, which will create an image that will be automatically printed by the end of the conversation. The creation of the image is visible the entire time on the screen.

Credits go out to Will for helping me with developing the concept for this project. 

**Rough sketch of the entire project**

Since I want to record a conversation, the project would need to be located in a quiet space. Ideally, I would like to place it in a small room. If that is not possible, I would construct a booth using thick black curtains as walls. 
I am thinking to use two different microphones as inputs to processing, and if that doesn’t work, I would just one microphone to record both voices. I need to borrow an I pad from the equipment center, because I need a screen without the keyboard. 
Additionally, I will need a photo printer, as this is a very important part of the idea. If I cannot manage to get a photo printer, I will simply print it on normal A4 paper. 

**List of parts you need that are not in your kit**

Acryllic glass, buttons, microphones(?), photo printer


**Description of the Arduino program**

The Arduino program will simply pass the input of button presses and audio stream to processing. 

**Description of the Processing program**

The main program will use the audiostream as an input and get the frequency and amplitude from it (I already wrote the code for that and it works well). 
This information is used in creating an image. 

**Things you need to learn that you don’t yet know**

How to control a printer using processing
How to access amplitudes at specific frequencies in processing

**Areas of greatest concern**

My greatest concern is that I won’t be able to get the materials that I need to build the project, such as the I pad, the physical enclosed space to exhibit the project, and the photo printer.
